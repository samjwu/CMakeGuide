# Stage 4 - Integrating a Third Party Library (GoogleTest) into the Project

This stage involves the steps to integrate a third-party library, GoogleTest, into the project using CMake.

To understand what is being done here, see the [main README Stage 4 explanation](../README.md#stage-4---integrating-a-third-party-library-googletest-into-the-project).

## Prerequisites

This stage continues to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Stage 0 as a text editor, though any text editor can be used, such as Notepad, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs, Atom, etc.

This stage continues to use the [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) toolchain to build the project on a Windows platform from Stage 1.

Use the [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) toolchain on a Linux platform or the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) toolchain for cross-platform capability.

This stage contiues to use the [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) build system generator from Stage 3.
