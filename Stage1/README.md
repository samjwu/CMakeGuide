# Stage 1 - Build the Project Manually

This stage involves the steps to build the project manually, which will be automated in later stages.

This builds the project that was set up in [Stage 0](../Stage0/README.md).

To understand what is being done here, see the [main README Stage 1 explanation](../README.md#stage-1---build-the-project-manually).

## Prerequisites

This stage uses the [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) toolchain to build the project on a Windows platform.

Alternatives include the [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) toolchain for a Linux platform or the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) toolchain for cross-platform capability.
