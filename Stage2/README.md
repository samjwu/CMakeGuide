# Stage 2 - Build the Project with make

This stage involves the steps to create a Makefile for the make build system to use and then executing the make command.

This automates the manual build commands from [Stage 1](../Stage1/README.md).

To understand what is being done here, see the [main README Stage 2 explanation](../README.md#stage-2---build-the-project-with-make).
