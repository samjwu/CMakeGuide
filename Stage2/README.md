# Stage 2 - Build the Project with make

This stage involves the steps to create a Makefile for the make build system to use and then executing the make command.

This automates the manual build commands from [Stage 1](../Stage1/README.md).

To understand what is being done here, see the [main README Stage 2 explanation](../README.md#stage-2---build-the-project-with-make).

## Prerequisites

This stage continues to use the [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) toolchain to build the project on a Windows platform from Stage 1.

Use the [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) toolchain on a Linux platform or the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) toolchain for cross-platform capability.
