# Stage 2 - Build the Project with make

This stage involves the steps to create a `CMakeLists.txt` for the CMake build system generator and using the `cmake` command to build the project.

This automates the creation of the `Makefile` from [Stage 2](../Stage2/README.md).

To understand what is being done here, see the [main README Stage 3 explanation](../README.md#stage-3---build-the-project-with-cmake).

## Prerequisites

This stage continues to use the [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) toolchain to build the project on a Windows platform from Stage 1 and 2.

Use the [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) toolchain on a Linux platform or the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) toolchain for cross-platform capability.
